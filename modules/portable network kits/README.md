# Portable Network Kit Section README

This module will include information on how to collaboratively build and understand a portable network kit. Much of the content will come from the [PNK website](http://pnkgo.com/), but will also need to be turned into engaging activities. 

Sections may include:
- setting up a router
- setting up the Raspberry Pi Server
- Velcroing and gluing it all together
- testing out your nodes
- Connecting it to the big internet
