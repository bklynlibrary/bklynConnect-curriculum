## Vocabulary / Jargon

**Community agreements**: The rules we set for ourselves that define how we’re going to interact with each other in this space.

**User experience design**: a process that involves talking to and observing possible users of your technology or service and then designing an experience that’s easy and intuitive to use, and that people actually like using. Does not involve coding. 

**Usability research**: A way to test out if the thing you built for people to use is useable. Involves giving people tasks to do in your product or service, and then observing where they get frustrated or confused. 

**Data**

**Packets**

**Wireless signal**

**Server**

**URL**

## Icebreaker
#### 10 mins - 4:00-4:10 

This should be make people smile, let people’s personalities shine, and begin to set the tone of the next several weeks. 

### Facilitation
- Go around: What is your name and the best thing you do or have done on or with the Internet?
- Remember these, because we’re going to use them later!

## Introduction
#### 15 mins - 4:10-4:25

Introduce self, instill confidence, and give clarity about the next couple of months.

### Facilitation
- Share who you are, your personal story, how you became interested in this topic, and what your role will be over the next few months in relation to the group
- Introduce the course/project

## Community Agreements
#### 10 minutes - 4:25-4:35
- “Community agreements are the rules we set for ourselves that define how we’re going to interact with each other in this space. These are a starting point, but we can add or subtract from these.”
- Have participants read each one and say what it means to them
- Ask if there are any additions or things people want to modify
- “If you see someone, or I see someone acting outside of these agreements, let’s just refer back. If they’re not working we can modify them.”

## Goals
#### 5 minutes - 4:35-4:40
- “What do you want to get out of this?”
- Ask someone to write these on a big piece of paper

## Big Map of the Internet 
#### 20 minutes - 4:40-5:00

Use the stories participants shared during the icebreaker to explain some or all of the following concepts:
- **Data**
- **Packets**
- **Wireless signal**
- **Server**
- **URL**

- For the stories you shared, draw out on a piece of paper representations of each piece of that interaction - for example, when I connect to reddit.com/r/makeupexchange, I use my (laptop) to reach another person’s (laptop) and we send (lipstick) through the (mail - string). 
- That’s the basic level. In this internship, we’re going to make this map a lot more crowded by asking a lot of How questions. 
- How does the message get from my computer to hers? Connects to (Wifi), wifi connects through (the phone line) goes to (reddit servers). Her computer sends a (request): “do I have any new messages?” and (reddit servers) send the message down. Also, she’s likely using (wifi) on her end.  
- Facilitate this through questions to participants (and ask them to draw the new pieces)

## Surveillance Videos and Discussion
#### 15 minutes - 5:20-5:35

- [Life inside china’s total surveillance state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ5LnY21Hgc) 
- [Propublica Breaking the Black Box, How Machines Learn to be Racist](https://www.propublica.org/article/breaking-the-black-box-how-machines-learn-to-be-racist)


## Working from the Future Activity
From Teaching Community Technology Handbook, page 48
#### 50 minutes - 5:35-6:25

### Facilitation:
- Prompt: It is the year 2045 and you are sitting in Osborn Plaza. How do you see the internet having an impact on the environment?
- Give learners five minutes to free-write what they see
- Have each person share their vision and record the main ideas on a large piece of paper in a central location
- Once everyone has shared, ask the group to brainstorm what needs to happen in order to make these visions come true. Create a list of ideas
- From this list of ideas, have a discussion about what needs to happen in this project to work towards those visions.
- Refine your list of ideas into a set of tangible goals for that project that reflect the learners’ vision. 

## Reflection and Posting to the Project Blog
#### 20 minutes

### Facilitation
- It’s important to document the work we do here, and what we learn publicly
- We all get a chance promote our work
- These things can be used in a portfolio later. 
- Prompt: Write about one thing you learned or found surprising today, and how you feel that it plays a part in your life. Also, write one big question you have.
- Small question: What’s the wifi password?
- Big question: Who decides what technology police are allowed to use for surveillance?
