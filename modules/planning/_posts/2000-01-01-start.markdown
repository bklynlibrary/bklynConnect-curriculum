# How to Use This Guide

This site documents the Spring 2018 BklynConnect Tech Lab Cohort, but also is meant to share resources that could be useful in any educational setting. 

This **Start** module is meant to be useful throughout your project, whether it's an hour long, or lasts more than a year. **Start** includes a guide on how to solicit democratic participation in your community technology project, to plan a curriculum based on the outcomes you'd like to see, to facilitate effectively, and to document, evaluate, and grow your project beyond yourself and your group. 

We recommend that you read through all of **Start**, then incorporate lesson plans and other pieces as-needed from the **[Data & Privacy](/bklynConnect-curriculum/modules/data & privacy/overview/)**, **[Prototyping Consent](/bklynConnect-curriculum/modules/prototyping%20consent/start/)**, and **[Portable Network Kits](/bklynConnect-curriculum/modules/portable network kits/start/)** modules. 

## Making a Learning Sandwich 

Every educational setting starts with a plan, and with setting the scene, followed by the lesson, and documentation and evaluation. 

## Remix, Respond, Relay 

This is an open curriculum, meaning that we *want* your critique, feedback, and suggestions and ultimately, for you to "steal" it, make it yours, and share it forward.
