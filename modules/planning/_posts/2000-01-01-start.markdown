# How to Use This Guide

This site documents the Spring 2018 BklynConnect Tech Lab Cohort, but also is meant to share useful resources for any educational setting. 

This module is meant to be useful throughout your engagement, whether it is an hour long, or a year. It includes a guide to soliciting democratic participation in your community technology project, to planning a curriculum based on the outcomes you'd like to see, to facilitate effectively, and to documenting, evaluating, and growing your project beyond your group. 

We recommend that you read this whole section, then grab modules and lesson plans as-needed from the Data & Privacy, Prototyping Consent, and Portable Network Kit modules. 

Every educational setting starts with a plan, and with setting the scene, followed by the lesson, and documentation and evaluation. 


## Remix, Respond, Relay 

This is an open curriculum, meaning that we *want* your critique, feedback, and suggestions and ultimately, for you to steal it, make it yours, and share it forward.
