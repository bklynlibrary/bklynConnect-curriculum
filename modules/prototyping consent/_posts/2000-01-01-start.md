# Prototyping Consentfulness


## Updates
#### 10 mins - 4-4:10

## What is Technology?
#### 10 mins - 4:10-4:20

## Building Consentful Tech
#### 40 mins - 4:20-5:00

### Objectives
- Practice teaching each other
- Learn about possible other ways of building technologies
- Prepare for the project on speculative technology

### Facilitation
- Everyone read 1-7 together (2 minutes)
- Pair up and read, then discuss the question. Take notes in an etherpad. (7 minutes) After 5 minutes, come back to the larger group, explain the section to the group, and then share your answer to the question (5 minutes)
	- P. 8-9: Understanding Consent is as easy as F.R.I.E.S.
		- How might we expand this definition to addres the intangible and networked qualities of digital technologies?
	- P. 10-11
		- Think of a techonlogy you use on a day to day basis. Can it have unjust or inequitable impacts on anyone? 
		- Who owns the technology, and who participates in the making of it?
		- Consider the technology you were thinking of earlier. What would it lok lik if it was build to ensure that everyone had an equitable experience, and some users were not negatively impacted more than others? Who would need to own and build the technology for this to happen?
	- P. 14-16: Consent from the ground up
		- How might the technologies we are most reliant upon look if they were designed with consent at their core? What if, before writing a single line of code, the following questions were asked?
- Repeat (12 minutes)
	- P. 17-18: Consent is an ongoing process
	- P. 19-20: Consentful technology relies on community and accountability
		- What would a community accountability approach to digital communities look like? How would it work for both people who are users of technology in question, as well as people who might be impacted by it? How could this change the way that the creators of algorithms are held accountable for the harms that their biases cause?
	- P. 21-22 Digital bodies are connected to each other in digital relationships and communities, Strong communities give rise to more consentful technologies

	<h3>Notes from BklynConnect</h3>

	<h4>Read P. 8-9: Understanding Consent is as easy as F.R.I.E.S.</h4>
	<p>F.R.I.E.S.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Freely Given: permission</li>
		<li>Reversible: anyone could change their mind at any time - you can change your username on snapchat</li>
		<li>Informed: they should be honest, you should be smart, reading applications terms and conditions before logging in</li>
		<li>Enthusiastic: for example, when you get friend requests from people you don't like, but you still feel like you have to add them</li>
		<li>Specific: Might say yes to one thing but not want to say yes to everything</li>
	</ul>
	<p>How might we expand this definition to address the intangible and networked qualities of digital technologies?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We can expand this definition by  starting programs that teaches people about consent in a more simple way.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Read P. 10-11: Consent makes Technology more Just and Equitable</h4>
	<p>Think of a technology you use on a day-to-day basis. Can it have unjust or inequitable impacts on anyone?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>snapchat /it can because some people may be okay with everyone knowing everthing about you</li>
		<li>Who owns the technology, and who participates in the making of it?</li>
		<li>evan spigel is the onwer of snapchat</li>
		<li>Some websites let you give feedback</li>
		<li>graphic designers</li>
		<li>people to test it out</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Consider the technology you were thinking of earlier. What would it look like if it was built to ensure that everyone had an equitable experience, and some users were not negatively impacted more than others? Who would need to own and build the technology for this to happen?</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Someone that is okay with looking at the outlook of everybody, and not just one person</li>
		<li>Apps should have more of a safety thing to prevent people being exposed</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>P. 14-16: Consent from the ground up</h4>

	<p>How might the technologies we are most reliant upon look if they were designed with consent at their core?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>so you can trust the people that looks at our things or update our snapchat and with their permission have it done</li>
		<li>For example, on snapchat, people can look at your location, but if they asked, most people would trust snapchat</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Read P. 17-18: Consent is an ongoing process</h4>

	<p>Answer any of the questions on these pages</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What about people who are not users?</li>
		<li>Let's say you get into a fight, and it's recorded on snapchat, and you become a meme, you go viral. That's sad, but it happens.</li>
		<li>Policy change: you should not be able to post something that is not yours.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Read P. 19-20: Consentful technology relies on community and accountability</h4>
	<p>What would a community accountability approach to digital communities look like?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Meetings, mediation</li>
		<li>Since you can't take back what you post, maybe technology solution where you can take down what you post</li>
		<li>Even if it's taken down, people will remember. Make a poster campaign that says "stop the recording, stop the posting"</li>
		<li>Encourage allies to stand up against injustice - if a guy says to another guy "should I expose this girl" say no, that's not cool</li>
	</ul>
	<p>How would it work for both people who are users of technology in question, as well as people who might be impacted by it?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>People would learn from it</li>
		<li>It wouldn't matter what the technology was</li>
		<li>The positive outcome would be bigger than whatever negativity started it</li>
		<li>How could this change the way that the creators of algorithms are held accountable for the harms that their biases cause?</li>
		<li>They would start to look behind the times if they are not asking for consent before posting harmful videos</li>
		<li>They would lose customers and users if they don't listen to people</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Read P. 21-22 Digital bodies are connected to each other in digital relationships and communities and Strong communities give rise to more consentful technologies</h4>

	<p>How can we better protect each other?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Not posting anyone's personal information</li>
		<li>If someone tells you something, don't run your mouth</li>
		<li>How can we hold each other accountable as a community?</li>
		<li>just stay active with each other. meaning have trust and be mindful of other people</li>
		<li>If someone big is fighting someone little, be mindful of that</li>
		<li>We have programs like BCJC where we sit down and keep each other accountable</li>
		<li>at BCJC, they teach better ways to manage your anger. Leave it alone, walk away.</li>
		<li>How can we better support and uplift each other?</li>
		<li>not post anybodies personal information about other people and if it does happen to somebody try to be a person that they can talk to and let them know</li>
		<li>be a positive person in their life, because you don't know what's happening at home, or if they're going to kill themselves.</li>
		<li>Be on their side, be in their corner.</li>
		<li>You can kill a person with words moreso than you can do with fighting.</li>
	</ul>
