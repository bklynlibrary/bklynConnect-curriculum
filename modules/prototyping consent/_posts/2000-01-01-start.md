# Building Consentful Tech Zine

In 2017, Una Lee, Dann Toliver, and their design firm [And Also Too](https://www.andalsotoo.net/) published the [Building Consentful Tech Zine](https://www.andalsotoo.net/) as a provocation on how to think about and design for consentfulness.

This framing really resonated with our group, so we expanded it into a project where we prototype what this looks like in practice (and learned some interaction design methodologies on the way)!
