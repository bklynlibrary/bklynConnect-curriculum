## Building Consentful Tech
#### 40 mins - 4:20-5:00

### Objectives
- Practice teaching each other
- Learn about possible other ways of building technologies
- Prepare for the project on speculative technology

### Facilitation
- Everyone read 1-7 together (2 minutes)
- Pair up and read, then discuss the question. Take notes in an etherpad. (7 minutes) After 5 minutes, come back to the larger group, explain the section to the group, and then share your answer to the question (5 minutes)
	- P. 8-9: Understanding Consent is as easy as F.R.I.E.S.
		- How might we expand this definition to addres the intangible and networked qualities of digital technologies?
	- P. 10-11
		- Think of a techonlogy you use on a day to day basis. Can it have unjust or inequitable impacts on anyone? 
		- Who owns the technology, and who participates in the making of it?
		- Consider the technology you were thinking of earlier. What would it lok lik if it was build to ensure that everyone had an equitable experience, and some users were not negatively impacted more than others? Who would need to own and build the technology for this to happen?
	- P. 14-16: Consent from the ground up
		- How might the technologies we are most reliant upon look if they were designed with consent at their core? What if, before writing a single line of code, the following questions were asked?
- Repeat (12 minutes)
	- P. 17-18: Consent is an ongoing process
	- P. 19-20: Consentful technology relies on community and accountability
		- What would a community accountability approach to digital communities look like? How would it work for both people who are users of technology in question, as well as people who might be impacted by it? How could this change the way that the creators of algorithms are held accountable for the harms that their biases cause?
	- P. 21-22 Digital bodies are connected to each other in digital relationships and communities, Strong communities give rise to more consentful technologies
