# How to CONTRIBUTE

Wow, we're glad you want to help! There are a variety of ways to do this.

1. Check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/bklynlibrary/bklynConnect-curriculum/issues) to see what's still on the to-do list. If you have something you think should be done, you can even add your own new issue!
2. [Share your story](https://github.com/bklynlibrary/bklynConnect-curriculum/issues/16) about your specific context, so we have a better idea of who might use this curriculum, and how. 
3. Create a lesson plan, or edit an existing one. [Here is a tutorial](https://howto.p2pu.org/modules/tutorial/start/) from the creators of our website template on how to add one yourself. If you're not super psyched about navigating GitHub and pull requests, you can also [post it as a "New Issue" or as a comment](https://github.com/bklynlibrary/bklynConnect-curriculum/issues) on an existing issue. 
4. Front-end developers: Help us make this website more mobile friendly! The styling files for this site live in the [\_sass](https://github.com/bklynlibrary/bklynConnect-curriculum/tree/gh-pages/_sass) folder.
	- This is a [jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/), so once you clone the repository on your machine, you'll have to create a local jekyll server by using the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Thank you for your help!!!!!
