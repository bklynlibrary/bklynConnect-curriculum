## Welcome
Hi! Through the Brooklyn Public Library, we're coordinating the efforts of many people in Brooklyn to make wireless internet access and equitable technology training a reality for Brooklyn residents. We're excited you want to participate!

This README file is meant to give you information about the curriculum as it develops, and to let you know how you and/or people in your community can contribute. A pilot of the project is being collaboratively designed and built in Brownsville, by youth participating in the Brownsville Community Justice Center's tech lab, trainers from the New America Resilient Communities program, and anyone in Brownsville who might benefit from the network. This repository\[1\] will be used for collaborating on an open[2], reusable community technology curriculum for the program. 

- Visit the current iteration of [the curriculum site here](https://bklynlibrary.github.io/bklynConnect-curriculum/)
- However, right now, the most complete version of the curriculum lives in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sZLhq8VYMmUQGTuuZ0I7k-LEnMXuVUUwcUOOeXRQPus/edit?usp=sharing)

## Why this is important

It can often feel like we have little control over our personal information, and by extension, our lives. Using the internet, or just existing in a connected world with sensors and monitoring technologies enables surveillance by law enforcement, parents, peers, and schools, can affect access to opportunities and resources, and can expose us in ways we never asked for. We want learners to build an understanding of how to personally control what information is transmitted, but also why and how governments, corporations, and nonprofit institutions use and control our data and communication tools, and how to make change in these systems (and how to build our own alternatives). 

## How do we get this thing online?
The course is still in progress, and currently the curriculum lives in [a living Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sZLhq8VYMmUQGTuuZ0I7k-LEnMXuVUUwcUOOeXRQPus/edit?usp=sharing), but we still need to port it to a simple-to-navigate website, and to incorporate ways for anyone to remix the curriculum for their own needs. Check out the our guide on [How to Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md), and check out the [open issues](https://github.com/bklynlibrary/bklynConnect-curriculum/issues) to see what is still on our to-do list.


## What site template are you using?

This course was created using the [Jekyll Course template from P2PU](http://github.com/p2pu/jekyll-course-template), using their guide for how to create an online course: [howto.p2pu.org](http://howto.p2pu.org). 

## Glossary
- **repository** or **repo**: a collection of documents related to your project, in which you create and save new code or content
- **Open** or **working open**: terms used to refer to using the power, knowledge, and skills of a diverse community of volunteers to accomplish something a single person could not do along. Knowledge and information generated by the proejct is shared widely and freely, and others are allowed to build upon it, and to maximize its usefulness for everyone.  
- **Mesh** or **Community-driven mesh wireless network**: Mesh networks are wireless networks (WiFi) that connect communities by using inexpensive deveices to transmit wireless internet signals between each device and into the community, allowing anyone within the connectivity range to log on to the network and access the internet for free. 
- **Roadmap**: a document outlining the schedule of work to be done on a project
- **Issue**: the GitHub term for tasks, enhancements, and bugs. Use these to let us know about things that are wrong or should be addressed. 
- **DiscoTech**: Short for **Disco**vering **Tech**nology, this is a science-fair style community technology skill share event, where people from all walks of life in the neighborhood can teach and learn from one another about technology.
